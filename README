rpg-module: A Role-Playing Game Module document class for LaTeX

Version 1.1 2017/05/06

Includes:

rpg-basic-stats.sty, a package to typeset monster stat blocks from the
1981 Basic/Expert version of Dungeons and Dragons (Moldvay/Cook/Marsh)

rpg-1e-stats.sty, a package to typeset monster stat blocks from the
1st Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual, Fiend Folio and
Monster Manual 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rpg-module class is inspired by the old-school Dungeons and Dragons modules
of the 1980s and attempts to recapture the look and feel of those classic
adventures. In the examples directory, you will find several pages from D&D
modules of that era which have been typeset with this class and which you can
compare to the original documents.

This package also includes two style files for typesetting monster stat blocks:

1. The rpg-basic-stats style contains stat blocks for every monster from the
   Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert version of the game.

2. The rpg-1e-stats.sty contains stat blocks from the 1st Edition Advanced
   Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual, Fiend Folio and Monster Manual 2.
