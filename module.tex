authors to typeset their adventures with a minimum of effort. Write your adventure, add some simple markup notation as shown

This file is both a short tutorial and example of how to use the module class to typeset your fantasy role-playing game adventure.

\part{Introduction}

The module class is a free resource for authors of adventure modules for fantasy roleplaying games.
It is inspired by the look and feel of the ``Red Book'' Basic incarnation of the world's most popular FRPG.

To prepare your work using this class, you will need \LaTeX, a free document preparation system for high-quality
typesetting. The module class was developed and tested using \TeX Live, which you can download from
\href{https://latex-project.org/ftp.html}{the \LaTeX~Project website}.

Unlike a conventional word processor, the \LaTeX~philosophy is to separate the job of writing and editing content
from the job of typesetting it for publication. Authors can concentrate on writing their text without fussing
about what fonts to choose or what size the page margins or table columns should be. The module class takes care
of all that. Another advantage is that all documents produced using this template will have a similar look and
feel, so if you want to publish a series of works they will appear consistent.

LaTeX uses a markup language in order to describe document structure and presentation. This
file---\verb|module.pdf|---was created from the markup file \verb|module.tex|. If you open \verb|module.tex|
in an ordinary text editor, you will see the markup commands and some explanatory comments (prefixed by \%).
\LaTeX~converts your source text, combined with the markup and the module class, into a high quality PDF document.

You can find numerous tutorials online to get you started with the basics of document preparation using \LaTeX.
The rest of this document is a short tutorial on the module class and examples of its features.

\part{Using the Module Class}

\section{Class Options}

At the beginning of your document, load the module class with \verb|\documentclass[<options>]{module}|. You can
specify the following options:

\begin{description}
\item[a4paper]         Use A4 paper size (default)
\item[letterpaper]     Use US letter paper size
\item[sansserif]       Use a sans-serif font, URW Gothic (default).
\item[serif]           Use a serifed font. This option will use ITC Souvenir if available, URW Bookman otherwise.
\item[acdesc]          Use descending AC in stat blocks (default for Basic stats)
\item[acasc]           Use ascending AC in stat blocks
\item[acb1]            Use \href{http://zenopusarchives.blogspot.com/2014/02/ascending-ac-in-holmes-basic.html}{the B1 AC style} in stat blocks
\item[acsw]            Use \href{http://www.swordsandwizardry.com/}{Swords \& Wizardry} AC style in stat blocks
\item[basic]           Use Basic monster stat blocks (default)
\item[advanced]        Use Advanced monster stat blocks (not currently implemented, planned for a future release)
\end{description}

\subsection*{Paper Size}

The module supports the letter paper size (used in USA) and A4 (used in Europe and the rest of the world). Changing the paper size
does not scale the text on the page; rather it adjusts the margins so the pages will be typeset identically regardless
of which size is selected. This allows module writers to easily create two almost identical PDFs for use in different regions.

As A4 pages are slightly taller, you have the option of a running header if you select \verb|a4paper|.

\subsection*{Fonts}

You can select a serifed or sans-serif font. The default font is URW Gothic (sans-serif), a free font which is similar to
ITC Avant Garde Gothic. Avant Garde was used in many early TSR modules, including B1 and B2.

If you choose the serif option, the module class will check if ITC Souvenir is installed on your system and configured for
\LaTeX~to use. Souvenir is the font used for the 1981 Basic rulebook and several modules of that era. Souvenir is a
commercial font which you must have a license to use. It is expensive to buy the font directly, but it was bundled with some
versions of CorelDraw, so that is a more economical way to obtain a license. To configure the font for use with \LaTeX, you
will need the Adobe Type 1 font definitions (.pfb and .afm files) from CorelDraw and the corresponding LaTeX .tfm and .vf files,
which you can obtain from the \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/corelpak}{Corelpak} package. The
\href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/corelpak-contrib}{Corelpak-contrib} package may also be useful to help with installation.

If you don't have Souvenir installed, the module class will use URW Bookman instead. Bookman is included in the standard
\TeX Live distribution.

\subsection*{Stat Blocks}

This version of the class includes Basic-style monster stat blocks, but it is possible to define a new stat block format for any
RPG system. In principle, authors will be able to compile their work with stats for different systems simply by changing one option
to \verb|documentclass|.

\section{Layout Options}

\subsection*{Headings}

The following heading styles are supported:

\begin{description}
\item[\textbackslash part] Chapter heading (numbered, included in table of contents)
\item[\textbackslash section] Section heading (not numbered, left justified, upper case, included in table of contents)
\item[\textbackslash section*] Section heading (alternate section style, not numbered, centred, included in table of contents)
\item[\textbackslash subsection] Location key (numbered)
\item[\textbackslash subsection*] Other subheading (same style as location key, not numbered)
\item[\textbackslash subsubsection] Sub-location key (numbered with number and letter, e.g. 7a.
\item[\textbackslash subsubsection*] Sub-location key (not numbered, same style as location key)
\end{description}

Location keys are numbered automatically, but you can control the numbering using the \verb|\setcounter| command. For example,
if you want to restart your room location keys at 1 on the second level of your dungeon, just insert |\setcounter{subsection}{0}|
before the first section heading.

If you want a table of contents in your document, simply place a \verb|\tableofcontents| command where you would like it to appear.

\section{Tables}

The module class uses the standard \verb|tabular| environment for tables. You need to specify the horizontal alignment of each column as 
usual. The class provides a \verb|\tableheader| macro which centres the table headings and writes a horizontal rule under each
one. You can redefine the column type for headings: the example below uses the \verb|[b]| option to get bold headings.

\section*{Variable Weapon Damage Table}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
\tableheader[b]{Damage & Weapon Type}
1-2 (1d2) & Small Fruit Knife\\
1-4 (1d4) & Torch\\
1-6 (1d6) & Hand Axe\\
1-8 (1d8) & Battle Axe\\
1-10 (1d10) & Two-handed sword\\
6-36 (6d6) & Laser Cannon\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent If you need to squeeze wide tables into a text column, you can reduce \verb|\tabcolsep|, which controls the spacing between table columns.

\section*{Character Attacks}

\begin{center}
\addtolength{\tabcolsep}{-4.1pt}
\begin{tabular}{lccccccccccccc}
\tableheader{Attacker's Level & 9 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -2 & -3}
Normal man & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 20 & 20 & 20\\
1st to 3rd & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 20 & 20\\
4th + higher & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20\\
\end{tabular}
\addtolength{\tabcolsep}{4.1pt}
\end{center}

\part{Second Dungeon Level}

If you want to have some pages with a single column of text, you can use \verb|\onecolumn| to switch
into one-column mode and \verb|\twocolumn| to switch back to two-column mode. These commands cause
a page break.

If you want to mix single and double-column text on the same page, use the \verb|onecolumnfloat| environment
to create a float which is the full width of the page. You can do the same thing with graphics using
the \verb|figure*| environment, as we do for the map on p.\pageref{img:map}.
