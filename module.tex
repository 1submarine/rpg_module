\abstract{This template is provided as a resource for authors of adventure modules for fantasy roleplaying games.
The template requires \LaTeX, a free document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. Unlike a conventional
word processor, the \LaTeX~philosophy is to separate the job of writing content from the job of typesetting it for
publication. The idea is that authors can produce beautifully laid out documents without needing to know anything
about typesetting. It also frees authors from all that fiddly adjusting fonts and resizing images. Another advantage
is that all documents produced using this template will have a similar look and feel, so it's ideal if you want to
publish a series of works.

Using this template as an example, you can write your adventure and turn it into a perfectly-formatted PDF in a few
clicks. You are free to use this for your private texts or for works you distribute for free or commercially (see
details of the license below). Have fun, and unleash your creativity on an unsuspecting world!}

\part{Introduction}

The first thing you need to be aware of is that LaTeX uses a markup language in order to describe document structure and presentation. What LaTeX does is to convert your source text, combined with the markup, into a high quality document. For the purpose of analogy, web pages work in a similar way: the HTML is used to describe the document, but it is your browser that presents it in its full glory - with different colours, fonts, sizes, etc.

\part{Usage}

% \documentclass[a4paper]{dnd_module}
%
% Accepts 'letter' or 'a4paper' options to specify page size. The amount of text on each page is not changed;
% the only difference between the two options is the size of the top margin and left/right margins. This allows
% module writers to easily create two almost identical PDFs for use in USA and Europe/rest of the world.

\section{Fonts}

% Choose \rmdefault to select the serifed font and \sfdefault for a sans-serif font
% If you are using the serifed font, the ITC Souvenir, the font used in the Moldvay Basic rulebook from 1981)

The \texttt{\textbackslash onecolumn} command can be used to switch into single column mode. \texttt{\textbackslash twocolumn} switches back to two-column mode. However,
these commands do not allow mixing one- and two-column text on the same page. If you would like to have just part of a page in one-column mode, use the custom
environment \texttt{minipage1col}.
